# Custom-Color-Themes
This repo contains custom color themes that I have made for Visual Studio.

The theme was created using the [Theme Editor For Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

The actual project files were created using the [VS2019 Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner&ssr=false#overview).

I don't recommend editing the theme with Theme Designer. However it is useful for speeding up the time involved with building the project.

Currently the only one that I have in here is the Dark Green theme. 

If you want to use it, feel free to get it from the releases section of this repository.
