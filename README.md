# Custom-Color-Themes
This repo contains custom color themes that I have made for Visual Studio. Specifically, this repo contians the Dark Green Theme I made. I may add others if time permits...

The theme was created using the [Theme Editor For Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

The actual project files were created using the [VS2019 Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner&ssr=false#overview).

- I don't recommend doing any actual editing on the theme with Theme Designer. The Theme Editor, while was not perfect, does not have as many problems as the Theme Designer. None the less, I DO recommend using the Theme Designer to package the theme up since it greatly simplfies making VSIX files for themes.
