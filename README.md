# Custom-Color-Themes
This repo contains custom color themes that I have made for Visual Studio. Specifically, this repo contians the Dark Green Theme I made. I may add others if time permits...

The theme was created using the [Theme Editor For Visual Studio 2019](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=VisualStudioPlatformTeam.VisualStudio2019ColorThemeEditor).

The actual project files were created using the [VS2019 Color Theme Designer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-madsk.ColorThemeDesigner&ssr=false#overview).

- I don't recommend editing the theme with Theme Designer. However it is useful for speeding up the time involved with building the project.


- If you want to use it, feel free to get it from the [releases section of this repo](https://github.com/dragnilar/Custom-Color-Themes/releases/tag/3).
